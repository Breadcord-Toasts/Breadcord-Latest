Thank you so much for helping to keep Breadcord safe and secure!

# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the **latest release of Breadcord** will be supported with security updates, as retroactively applying security updates to older versions is difficult to manage for all involved.

You are strongly advised to always use and update to the latest version of Breadcord wherever possible.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any repository, service or platform owned or managed by Breadcord, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure, to minimise the risk of zero-day attackers.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please send an email to [security@breadcord.com](mailto:security@breadcord.com).

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

- The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage and respond to your report more quickly.
